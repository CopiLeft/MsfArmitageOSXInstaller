This script is designed to assist in the install of metasploit/armitage on Mac OSX 10.9.1.

Added:
- Basic error-checking.
- Commands upto installing metasploit from github.

TODO
- Finish off the commands.
- Implement error-checking and logging for the above.
- Specifically check if programs are already installed instead of assuming not.

If you think I've missed anything or want a feature implemented then hit me up here or on twitter (@Sh3llc0d3)
